The sediment transport on a shoreline depends on the incident wave waves (height and direction).  The shoreline diffusivity is a parameter of use in one-line models of shoreline behavior.  (See the Java applets for <a href="oneline.html"> beach fill behavior</a>  and the <a href="groin.html">single groin evolution</a>.)    
<p>
Here you need to input the breaking wave height and wave angle to determine Q, the longshore sediment transport.  There is also an empirical constant K that needs to be supplied.  Experiments have shown that K is about 0.7.    To also determine G, the shoreline diffusivity, you need to input some geometry of the beach profile--the berm height and the depth of closure (the depth beyond which the profile does not change with time).
<p>
Assumed values:  sand porosity = 0.3, specific gravity of sand= 2.65, breaking index = 0.78.  To change the output values of Q and G for a different value of porosity (p), multiply the output values by (1-0.3)/(1-p).  For a different specific gravity (s), multiply the output by (2.65 - 1)/(s-1).
<p>
The formula used to calculate Q is:
<p>
Q = K E_b *C_b*sin(t)*cos(t)/(rho*g*(s-1)*(1-p)
<br>
where<br>
K is an empirical coefficient, taken as 0.77<br>
E_b 	wave energy at breaking<br>
C_b	group velocity at breaking<br>
t	wave angle at breaking<br>
rho	density of water<br>
g	acceleration of gravity<br>
s	specific gravity of sand<br>
p	porosity of sand
