Animations used in the Coastal Hydraulics course at Lund University.

Apparently, the original [site](http://www.coastal.udel.edu/faculty/rad/index.html) is broken. I found an alternative [link](http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~chinwu/Coastal_Java/) for the files and decided to also host them here. The files are now hosted as a backup at https://coastal-hydraulics.netlify.app/

To run these java applets in modern browsers, use the Google Chrome extension called [CheerpJ Applet Runner](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cheerpj-applet-runner/bbmolahhldcbngedljfadjlognfaaein).
