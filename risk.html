The Delaware Northeaster risk index is an assessment of beach/dune erosion potential of a beach as a result of a northeaster.  The input data are the deep water wave height of the storm, the predicted (or measured) storm surge at the beach, and the duration of the storm.
<p>
Northeasters with ratings of 1 to 2 create significant beach erosion but are not hazardous to structures at the beach.  Class 3 or higher are dangerous storms.  Class 5 are very dangerous and are similar to the March 1962 storm, which obliterated Delaware's sand dunes and caused $16 million (1962 dollars) in damages.

<p>
The model, while generic enough in principle to apply to other beaches, is calibrated for the Delaware shoreline.  Therefore it is not applicable to other regions.
